# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.


a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

new_list = []

def beg(x):
    new_list.append(x[0])
    new_list.append(x[-1])
    print(new_list)
    
beg(a)
